# ISN_FirstProject
My first project ever. 
Done with De Betignie Tanguy.
Python, a game, it work but do not stare at the code or your soul will be absorbed.

Really, i'm not lying. Its my ISN Project, i have 2 great teachers but not professinnal programmer.

- 1 File.
- Global variable everywhere (don't ask me why).
- No comment.

I will probably try to redo the game since i'm way better now to see the *(huge)* difference.

**Good luck if you really want to take a look at it.**
